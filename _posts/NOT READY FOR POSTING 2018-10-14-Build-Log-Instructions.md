# JTM45 Build Log/Instructions

## Introduction
This is a log of the JTM45 build. It is intended to become a JTM45 build instruction manual in an editable format as most (all?) online build instructions are only available in pdf and copyrighted. Of course this document is inspired by many of those.

**WARNING: A tube amplifier chassis contains lethal high voltage even when unplugged--sometimes over 700 volts AC and 500 volts DC.**
