Wednesday 03-10-2018: Just before 16:00 I ordered my JTM45 kit from ToneFactory for 555,- euro. Within minutes I received the build manual (which I've stored in Dropbox). A layout and schematic was not present. ToneFactory also did not have one, but provided me with with close matches. I found that the build-your-own-clone version was even closer. Also, pictures from the manual match perfectly with the ones on the Chinese MableAudio's site, where a low-res layout is present. Might check if ToneFactory can get a hi-res version, as they might get the kit there.

Thursday 04-10-2018: Around 12:00 the kit arrived. After some inspection it became clear some parts weren't delivered. A quick response on a mail to ToneFactory stated that they would sent the missing parts (see PartList.xsls). The screw, nuts etc where nowhere close and the manual was also not clear. 

Friday 05-10-2018: I fixed to mechanical parts to the chassis (excluding front and back) to see if I could figure out which screws and nuts I was missing.

Saturday 06-10-2018: Eventually I went to a hardware store and got myself a variety of screws and nuts. I started with an amp cradle to facilitate the build.

Sunday 07-10-2018: I finished the amp ![cradle](/assets/cradle.jpg). Generated an additional parts list (AdditionalParts.xlsx). Das MusikDing.de has the 2W metal film resistors, 5W 750V Metal Oxide resistors and some handy stuff.

Monday 08-10-2018: Mailed ToneFactory about the missing parts. Created the empty and populated turret board in DIYLC as a preparation for the alterations I'm planning to do. Some of these changes will be: Use the preferred input network as in 'Designing Tube Preamps for Guitar and Bass'; Move the grid stoppers to the tube sockets; Change the bias supply to the one discussed at [the site](http://www.valvewizard.co.uk/bias.html) of Merlin Blencowe.

Tuesday 08-10-2018: DIYLC files are available:
- [Empty turretboard](/assets/TurretBoardOnly.diy)
- [Original turretboard](/assets/TurretBoardWithComponents.diy)
- [New turretboard](/assets/TurretBoardWithComponentsNew.diy)

New turretboard is currently rough, but the plan is it will be updated in the future.
