**Wednesday 03-10-2018**: Just before 16:00 I ordered my JTM45 kit from ToneFactory for 555,- euro. Within minutes I received the build manual (which I've stored in Dropbox). A layout and schematic was not present. ToneFactory also did not have one, but provided me with with close matches. I found that the build-your-own-clone versions were even closer.
- [BYOC Schematic](http://byocelectronics.com/brit45schematic.pdf)
- [BYOC Layout](http://byocelectronics.com/jtm45-240v.pdf)
- [BYOC Build Instructions](http://byocelectronics.com/brit45instructions.pdf)
- [MableAudio Layout](http://www.mableaudio.com/uploadFile/Picture_small/201710251152564297.jpg)

Might check if ToneFactory can get a hi-res version, as they might get the kit there.

**Thursday 04-10-2018**: Around 12:00 the kit arrived. After some inspection it became clear some parts weren't delivered. A quick response on a mail to ToneFactory stated that they would sent the missing parts. See [PartList](/assets/PartList.xslx). The screw, nuts, etc. where nowhere close and the manual was also not clear. 

**Friday 05-10-2018**: I fixed to mechanical parts to the chassis (excluding front and back) to see if I could figure out which screws and nuts I was missing.

**Saturday 06-10-2018**: Eventually I went to a hardware store and got myself a variety of screws and nuts. I started with an amp cradle to facilitate the build.

**Sunday 07-10-2018**: I finished the amp cradle. ![cradle](/assets/cradle.jpg) Generated an [additional parts list](/assets/AdditionalParts.xlsx). [Das MusikDing](https://www.musikding.de/) has the 2W metal film resistors, 5W 750V Metal Oxide resistors and some handy stuff.

**Monday 08-10-2018**: Mailed ToneFactory about the missing parts. Created the empty and populated turret board in DIYLC as a preparation for the alterations I'm planning to do. Some of these changes will be: Use the preferred input network as in 'Designing Tube Preamps for Guitar and Bass'; Move the grid stoppers to the tube sockets; Change the bias supply to the one discussed at [the site](http://www.valvewizard.co.uk/bias.html) of Merlin Blencowe.

**Tuesday 08-10-2018**: DIYLC files are available:
- [Empty turretboard](/assets/TurretBoardOnly.diy)
- [Original turretboard](/assets/TurretBoardWithComponents.diy)
- [New turretboard](/assets/TurretBoardWithComponentsNew.diy)

New turretboard is currently rough, but the plan is it will be updated in the future. Also updated layout, links and images of this blog. Also posted it to http://tomkamphuys.github.io .

**Wednesday 10-10-2018**: Started a [thread](http://www.tdpri.com/threads/jtm45-build.881258/) at TDPRI. Started a schematic.

**Thursday 11-10-2018**: Band practice.

**Friday 12-10-2018**: Finished first iteration of schematic.

**Saturday 13-10-2018**: Received the parts from ToneFactory and installed them. Bias circuit etc. added to schematic.

**Sunday 14-10-2018**: As I will be using a multiple star grounding scheme (as described in Blencowe's book), which is different from the manual, I was looking around where I should put the safety-earth. I found no hole for a dedicated screw close to the mains inlet, so I will have to drill that.

I found that the input tube sockets were loose in their chassis mount. They were the shielded version, which I choose for (possible) lower noise. Three chassis clamps without a shield were also supplied and these did clamp the sockets tightly to the chassis.

Also the output tube sockets were loose. These have small metal parts that clamp the ceramic socket to the metal chassis mount, which I tightened with a long nose plier.

Looking for resistors.

- Metal film
    - Vishay CPF1 1W, 250V, 1%
    - Vishay CPF2 2W, 350V, 1%
    - Vishay CPF3 3W, 500V, 1%
    - Vishay CCF60 1W, 500V, 1%
    - Vishay PR03 3W, 750V, 5% (probably). I think these are suitable for the plate load resistors and cathode follower cathode resistor. They need high power and voltage spec (see e.g. [Aiken](http://aikenamps.com/index.php/technical-q-a)), tolerance is not that important.
    - Vishay CMF70 1.75W, 500V, 1%, 0.1uV/V
    - Yageo FMP200 2W, 500V, 1%
    - Royal Ohm MF200, 2W, 500V, 1%

**Tuesday 16-10-2018**: Started a [thread](http://www.tdpri.com/threads/humdinger-physical-location.882729/) to get some info about the humdinger placement. Decided to go with the fender chassis mount pots. ToneFactory has both the [bias](https://www.tonefactory.nl/cts-10k-linear-bias) and [humdinger](https://www.tonefactory.nl/fender-potmeter-hum-controll-100r) pot. Then order the [higher voltage elco](https://www.tonefactory.nl/f-t-15-f-at-500-volt) as well. For resistors Das Musikding seems best.

**Wednesday 17-10-2018**: Fixed (as in repaired) bias (two errors...) added scale control. Made a diagram in LTSPICE for both the (semi) original version and the my version. Compared Bode plots of original cap values with the smaller ones:
![BodePlot](/assets/BodePlot.png)

**Thursday 18-10-2018**: Cathode bypass formula in [Choosing Bypass Capacitors](http://valvewizard.co.uk/ChoosingBypassCaps.pdf) is different from [Radiotron Designers Handbook Rev. 4](http://www.tubebooks.org/Books/RDH4.pdf) (p. 484). Changed the Matlab/Octave code to represent Radiotrons version. Comparison of the input stages does not make sense. Different behaviour for the LTSPICE model.
![BodePlotAndCathodeBypass](/assets/BodePlot+cathodeBypass.png)

**Friday 19-10-2018**: I had resistors in the power supply, but no capacitors (and no AC). Removed resistors. Updated BodePlot as seen above (Wednesday). Wrote a script that takes a LTSPICE Bode plot output file and seperates the transfer function for the selected parts of the system.

**Saturday 20-10-2018**: Using the splitCircuit script to analyse, adjusted several caps. Cathode bypass cap changed, but conservatively. Coupling caps around LTPI a bit smaller to limit blocking distortion. First stage should not clip, so left original values in place. Still feel that most could be smaller, but for this first build I'm going to stop here.

**Sunday 21-10-2018**: Don't know..

**Monday 22-10-2018**: Finally ordered the parts at MusikDing and ToneFactory. 

**Tuesday 23-10-2018**: Wrote a [Grounding Scheme post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-23-GroundingScheme %}). I added a turret and a separate wire to the *positive* star.

**Wednesday 24-10-2018**: Started with a [layout](/assets/Layout.diylc) in diylc. It will be a lot of work, but I think it will help in figuring out the grounding scheme. Current version (WIP):
![Layout](/assets/Layout_24102018.png)
Quite a lot of work has been done. Grounding still has to be done.

**Thursday 25-10-2018**: Continued with the layout. Don't know whether strictly following the grounding scheme actually makes a bigger mess of the wiring...
![Layout](/assets/Layout_25102018.png)

**Friday 26-10-2018**: Took the liberty to move around some parts to make the star ground cleaner. Looks very similar to Larry's Grounding Scheme.

**Saturday 27-10-2018**: Wrote a [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-27-Tips-And-Tricks %}) about the tooling I use/wrote.

**Sunday 28-10-2018**: Color coded the wires according to ![ColorCoding](/assets/Wiring-Colors.gif). Power supply (red) and ground (black) override other colors (e.g. cathode follower plate (blue)).
Nice Layout for inspiration:

**Monday 29-10-2018**: Mounting positions of the turret board coincide in two cases with a to be added turret. Need to solve that.

**Tuesday 30-10-2018**: Parts from Das MusikDing have arived in perfect order. Parts in separate bags and all resistors labelled (value).

**Friday 02-11-2018**: Have been quite busy this week writing some software to compare the layout and schematic in DIYLC to each other. It's starting to look good:
![vergelijking](/assets/NetListComparison.png)

**Saturday 03-11-2018**: Finally did some work on the amp. Drilled three holes!!! ...and mounted the bias pot, humdinger pot and the line chassis ground.
![image](/assets/Photos/IMG_20181103_185334215.jpg)

Drilling the holes first with a drill 0.5-1.0mm smaller than the desired hole, seems to help in getting a nice round hole.
Had to cut a piece of the cap can holder as it kept the pot from mounting flush to the chassis.
Finished the turret mounting tool and mounted one turret. Turret is too long for my turret board... the 3mm must have meant the length and not the diameter.

**Sunday 04-11-2018**: Finally did some soldering. I managed to finish the heater wiring. Getting the two wires into the pre amp sockets was a real PITA.
![image](/assets/Photos/IMG_20181104_213926685.jpg)

**Monday 05-11-2018**: Mounted the face plates and all pots, jacks, etc. Looking good:
![image](/assets/Photos/IMG_20181105_222450914.jpg).

Bourns pots (Scale Control and Presence) feel a bit looser compared to the Alpha pots. Based on feel (alone) I would choose Alpha's for the future.

**Wednesday 07-11-2018**: soldered the heater wire to the rectifier tube. Prepared some more for soldering the various power transformer leads. Did not solder as my soldering iron broke down. Will probably need a new 'bout'. 

Removed the standby switch (connections) from the layout. Standby should not be needed and the wires went back and forth the chassis.
